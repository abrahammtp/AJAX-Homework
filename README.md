# Sports Paradise

In this application, we will use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs that are sports related. We are going to use AJAX to make our API calls, and the application is going to be built using JavaScript and jQuery. The application is going to open with five buttons at the top (each one of them is a sport) and when you click on one of this buttons the page is going to provide you with ten gifs that are related to that given sport. You can click on the gif to play it, and also click again to pause it.

If you wish to work on this project on your own, you can clone down the repo and run the application on the browser. If you decide to build something like this, you are going to need a GIPHY API key. You can obtain the key by creating an account with GIPHY and following their instructions https://developers.giphy.com/
